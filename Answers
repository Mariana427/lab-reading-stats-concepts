## Challenges 

  

### Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean? 

  

The expected value is the sum of the probabilities for a case to occur. This value is closer to the mean as we perform more trials for the same event. A good example is the game "tossing a coin". In this game we have a 0.5 probability of having Heads or Tails. For this reason, the expected value is 0.5. But if we only toss the coin 5 times is very likely that the mean will not be 0.5. The more times we toss the coin the closer the mean and the expected value will be similar. 

  

### Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values? 

  

The bigger problem is the interpretation of the p-value. The advance of science was come with a lot of advantages for the humanity, but with the quantity of magazines and other places that the persons was on their disposal to share the results they have every day is more difficult to filter on the pages and pages of pretty results that much of the time have a total contribute for the science of 0.  

The search for the perfect p is a real problem for the scientific community since or you have the so call “significative differences” or you are unable to share your work nowadays.  

For all this reasons the p value is most of the times poorly interpreted and since for example to be able to publish your work on a magazine you need to compare results with previews works, you ended up with contradictory or byased values.  

  

### Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing. 

I chose the netflix article. On this article they try to demonstrate if changing the art of a picture they were able to increase the active time of the subscribers. I think that in complementation such be interesting to test different regions and to point the main characteristics of the art with bigger results.
